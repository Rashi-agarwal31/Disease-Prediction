# Disease-Prediction with Machine Learning
This repository contains the codebase for a machine learning model named "Disease Prediction", developed in Python. The primary goal of this project is to accurately predict diseases based on entered symptoms. Leveraging a comprehensive dataset, the model aims to match symptoms to potential diseases, providing accurate and timely diagnostic recommendations. This tool can be invaluable for medical practitioners and individuals seeking preliminary health assessments.

Key Features:

Machine Learning model trained on a curated dataset of symptoms and corresponding diseases.
User-friendly interface for symptom input and disease prediction.
Robust and accurate disease identification based on symptom matching.
Extensible architecture allowing for easy integration with other healthcare systems.

How to Use:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies.
Run the application and input the symptoms to get disease predictions.
